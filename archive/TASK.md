# List of Task to do.  

1. [DONE] Transfer the Generate AI Image Button to other section below to the first image generation.
2. [DONE] Transfer the CSCI label and value above the sliders and put emphasis
3. [DONE] Make the CSCI label and value a 3 point bigger and bold.
4. [DONE]  Let us put content inside the div in index.html with class = "ai-image". This Section should have a title AI Image Generation. Before the "Generate AI Image". After clicking the "Generate AI Image" an image below the button should appear. Please refer integration.md under docs folder on how to do it. The image generated should correspond the value of Information Density, Knowledge Area, and Cognitive Complexity. Please refer Readme.md for possible upgrade.
5. [DONE] Create a similar concept image to Canvass under the AI Image. You can replicate its code to a new Javascript file. The values are the same in a new concept that look like space or different object.Refer to integration.md for the generation of image.
6. [DONE] The numbers of stars will correspond the size of “knowledge area”. While its arrangement or formation will stand for “mindset” or how you understand things. The stars will become blur or even disappear when not being touched for a long time. But some of stars will always exist or even glowing forever. The speed of movement you create will correspond the “information density”. Doing movements will add another stars, it means it will increased your Knowledge Area. When you do it faster which shows high density, you will have faster increase of Knowledge like how fast you intake new information or provide new idea. The pattern of your movements will correspond the “cognitive complexity”. The arrangement of the stars after each movements will show how your understanding or mindset will look like. So, simple movements like small swipe will not going to change anything, while complicated pattern movements that shows high cognitive complexity will make a total different arrangement that shows a result of total different mindset or understanding. Sometimes, from that complexity, it may result wrong new mindset showing a scatter arrangement due to rough pattern you did like random zigzag. But if the movement is smooth, even if it is complex like spiral, the arrangement will be organized or even creatively arranged like constellation that shows good mindset. Adaptability of the stars to follow when detect movement will also be influenced by its size that stand for knowledge size. Higher knowledge size will make it heavy that result higher inertia. It means, even how high cognitive complexity you have, it is not easy to change your mindset or understanding when you have this enough needed high Knowledge.
7. [DONE] Make the Quantum Mode Toggle functional. The Consciousness Art Canvass should behave like Quantum when the toggle is On. If it is off, keep it the same or with its original setup and configuration.

# Project Overview

This project is an interactive art generator that creates AI-generated images and dynamic visualizations based on user input. It is designed to work seamlessly on both computers and touchscreen devices, offering a unique and engaging experience for users.

## Features

1. **AI Image Generation**
   - Users can generate AI images by adjusting parameters such as Information Density, Knowledge Area, and Cognitive Complexity.
   - The generated image appears below the "Generate AI Image" button.

2. **Dynamic Scene Generator**
   - A separate section generates a scene or landscape based on the same parameters.
   - The scene adapts dynamically to user input, creating visually stunning results.

3. **Consciousness Art Canvas**
   - A canvas that visualizes the user's mindset and understanding through star patterns.
   - Features include:
     - Stars representing Knowledge Area, with their size and arrangement reflecting mindset and cognitive complexity.
     - Dynamic behavior influenced by user interaction, such as movement speed and patterns.
     - Quantum Mode Toggle for advanced visualization.

4. **Quantum Mode**
   - When enabled, the Consciousness Art Canvas behaves in a quantum-like manner, adding complexity and unpredictability to the visualization.

5. **Responsive Design**
   - The application is fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.
   - Touchscreen support allows for intuitive interaction on phones and tablets.

6. **Girly and Classy Corporate Theme**
   - The design features a pink-themed color palette with elegant typography and rounded corners, creating a visually appealing and professional look.
